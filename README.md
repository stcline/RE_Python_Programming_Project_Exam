# :robot: RE Python Programming Project Exam
You made it!  We learned a lot about Python this semester.  Now it is time to show what you can do.  For this assignment you will write at least one Python script (If you choose to build your own module, then you will submit more).  The project you create will also do something physical with your Raspberry Pi.  

### Here are the requirements:
- Basic Requirements: You must write at least one Python script which includes the following concepts:
  - Control some sort of physical device like LEDs (or an RGB LED), a servo, a DC motor
  - Accept user input
  - Utilize variables
  - Implement conditionals (if, elif, else)
  - Utilize loops (any kind of loop)
  - Contains at least one class which accepts positional arguments as attributes and provides at least one method
- Options (which will earn extra credit - since you will have to learn more on your own):
  - Store data in a list, a tuple or a dictionary
  - Create a module and import it into your main script
  - Use an extra sensor to accept input besides the keyboars (potentiometer, button(s), limit switch(es), photocell, etc.)
  - Control a more complicated device like an LCD screen or a stepper motor

### How to Submit Your Project Exam:
1. Clone this repo to your Raspberry Pi.
2. Write and test your script(s) which does what you intend it to do.
3. Add and commit your script(s) to your local branch.
4. Push changes to here.
5. Build your project on a breadboard and create some kind of schematic of it. Could be something very formal from a site like Circuitlab or it could just be drawn on graph paper, photographed and uploaded here.
6. Keep your project built so you can show it to everyone on Tuesday in class.

Good Luck :rocket:
